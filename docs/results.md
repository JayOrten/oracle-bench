# Results and artifacts reference

Every `oracle-bench run` creates a timestamped attempt directory beneath the
configured `output` path. The directory is the complete record of one agent
attempt: its inputs, resolved dataset instance, runtime, agent activity, captured
submission, reference check, paired evaluations, and report.

A run that stops early contains only the files produced before the failure. For
example, an image-build failure will not have generation or evaluation artifacts.
Consult `status.json` and the last stage log when expected files are absent.

## Judge workspace manifests

`workspace-spec.json` records the workspace-layout version, prepared image ID
and digests, base commit, patch, rubric and container-helper hashes,
repository-view construction method, reconstruction commands, and every exposed
artifact. The separate
`bundle-manifest.json` is the compact destination-to-SHA-256 inventory.

The disposable container receives `/oracle-judge/buggy` and
`/oracle-judge/golden` repository views, the generated submission in both views,
the issue and patches, and saved evaluation evidence. Oracle Bench verifies the
submission bundle before transfer and checks every generated file again inside
both views. Repository views are not copied back to the host; the saved run
artifacts and workspace specification are the reproducible inputs.

Run the judge independently after paired evaluation:

```sh
uv run oracle-bench judge runs/<run-id>
```

The command requires the configured judge credential and the saved runtime image.
It writes the exact prompt and raw final response before validating
`judgment.json`. Invalid model output is retained as `status: invalid_output` and
is not retried automatically. Harness failures and deadlines produce explicit
`failed` and `timed_out` judgments. A rerun archives the complete prior attempt
under `judge-history/<UTC timestamp>/` before rebuilding the workspace.

## Interactive human judging

Create a blinded human workspace from the same saved `workspace-spec.json` used
for model judging:

```sh
uv run oracle-bench judge-workspace create runs/<run-id> --rater rater_01
```

The command reconstructs the bundle and refuses to continue if its specification
differs from the saved one. It leaves a named container running without network
access or model credentials and prints commands for opening a shell or attaching
VS Code. The common evidence is read-only; the non-root `oracle` user can write
only `/oracle-judge/output/`. LLM responses and earlier human ratings are never
uploaded into this container.

Write the six rubric fields to `/oracle-judge/output/judgment.json`, then collect
and validate them:

```sh
uv run oracle-bench judge-workspace collect <container-name>
uv run oracle-bench judge-workspace remove <container-name>
```

Invalid JSON or invalid labels do not stop or remove the workspace, allowing the
rater to correct the draft. A valid rating is saved under
`judge/human/<opaque-rater-id>/` with both the submitted JSON and normalized
result. Its `provenance.json` records the hashes of the rubric, common workspace
specification, and exact human instruction file. Collection refuses to overwrite
that result. To replace it deliberately,
pass `--archive-existing`; Oracle Bench first moves the previous files under
`judge/human-history/<opaque-rater-id>/<UTC timestamp>/`. The `remove` operation
checks the container's profile label and refuses to remove unrelated containers.
Rerunning the automated judge preserves these human artifacts. Reevaluation marks
both automated and human judgments stale because their execution evidence has
changed.

## Primary results

### `report.md`

The human-readable summary. It identifies whether test generation covered the
whole repository or a calculated localized target, then shows agent and evaluation
completion states, submission compliance, the paired pass/fail matrix, non-binary
outcomes, coverage, and links to artifacts that exist. When judging is configured,
it also shows judge status, harness and model provenance, all five rubric labels,
the rationale, and audit links. Generation and judge duration, usage, and cost are
reported separately.

The ground-truth section links the original issue and exact buggy-to-golden fix
for manual analysis. These private artifacts are written on the host and are not
mounted or copied into the generation container.

`oracle-bench report runs/<run-id>` regenerates this file from saved data. It does
not execute tests or call a model.

A run with no frozen rubric renders the judge as `disabled`; a frozen rubric
without `judgment.json` renders as `missing`. Failed, timed-out, invalid, and
stale judgments render their diagnostic fields without assuming successful label
fields are present.

## `judge/`

### `judge/judgment.json`

The normalized semantic annotation. A completed judgment contains `status`, the
five rubric labels, and `rationale`. Other states are explicit:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `invalid_output` | The final response was not one valid rubric JSON object |
| `failed` | Harness or judge-workspace execution failed |
| `timed_out` | The judge exceeded its selected wall limit or infrastructure watchdog |
| `stale` | Reevaluation replaced the execution evidence; the prior annotation is nested for audit |

### Judge model evidence

`judgment.raw.txt` preserves the final assistant response before parsing.
`prompt.md` and `rubric.md` preserve the exact instructions. `agent/result.json`
records status, usage, cost, duration, harness, provider, model, CLI version, and
the stopping limit that bounded the turn;
the neighboring command, version, trace, stderr, and final files have the same
roles as their generation counterparts.

### `evaluation/results.json`

The machine-readable aggregate for the generated tests. It is a validated
contract: per-version `tests.json` is checked as it enters the host from the
container, so unreadable runner output becomes an explicit incomplete result
rather than a missing outcome discovered later. Artifacts carry no schema
version; a file written by an earlier revision fails to load rather than being
partially interpreted.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `instance_id` | Dataset instance evaluated |
| `agent` | Copy of `generation/result.json` |
| `artifact_sha256` | Checksum over the generated-file manifest entries |
| `submission_compliant` | Whether the agent made only permitted changes |
| `forbidden_changes` | Paths changed outside the allowed submission policy |
| `task_scope` | `localized` or `repository`, matching the generation assignment |
| `test_target` | Sanitized localized code area delivered to the agent, or null |
| `existing_tests` | Test-visibility policy; `keep` means existing tests were visible |
| `buggy_status`, `golden_status` | Overall execution status for each version |
| `matrix` | Counts and test IDs in each binary paired cell |
| `tests` | One paired row per test ID |
| `other_outcomes` | Tests excluded from the binary matrix |
| `failure_kinds` | Assertion, other-exception, and unknown failure counts for each version |
| `coverage` | Normalized coverage summaries for both versions |

Diagnostic-only status is derived from `submission_compliant`. Detection in the
expected direction is derived from the `fail_on_buggy_pass_on_golden` matrix count;
neither value is duplicated as a separately persisted field.

Each `tests` row contains `test_id`, `buggy`, `golden`, and `cell`. Failed sides
also include `buggy_failure` or `golden_failure` with a diagnostic kind, exception
type, and message. `cell` is null when either execution is incomplete or an
outcome is not binary.

| Matrix key | Buggy | Golden | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pass_on_both` | pass | pass | Test accepts both implementations |
| `fail_on_buggy_pass_on_golden` | fail | pass | Test detects behavior repaired by the golden patch |
| `pass_on_buggy_fail_on_golden` | pass | fail | Test prefers buggy behavior or rejects the repair |
| `fail_on_both` | fail | fail | Test rejects both implementations |

These cells describe behavior; they do not prove whether an oracle is correct.
Skips, expected failures, setup or teardown errors, collection failures, missing
test IDs, and incomplete runs remain in `other_outcomes`.

### `status.json`

The latest lifecycle checkpoint, containing `stage`, `state`, `updated_at`, and an
error when applicable. Stages progress through `resolve`, `build`, `reference`,
`generate`, `evaluate`, optional `judge`, and `finished`. Capturing the
submission is part of the `generate` stage.

The final state is `completed` only when the agent and both evaluations completed
and the submission was compliant. `completed_with_errors` means the run retained
results but one of those conditions failed. The independent `judge_status` is
`disabled`, `completed`, `invalid_output`, `failed`, `timed_out`, `stale`, or
`missing`; judge failure does not replace a completed evaluation state. An early
exception records its stage and a failed state.

## Inputs and reproducibility

### `inputs/config.resolved.yaml`

The schema-versioned run lock. It expands the small input configuration with the
source adapter's repository `runtime`, Oracle Bench's pinned `toolchain`, agent
defaults, dataset revision, and absolute host paths. During a run, `task.prompt`
points to this attempt's frozen `prompt.txt`. Credentials and credential values
are not stored. See the [configuration reference](configuration.md).

### `inputs/instance.json`

The resolved dataset record and provenance. It includes the base commit, golden
repair patch, private reference-test patch and IDs, source dataset metadata, a
record hash, and the original record. This is private evaluator data that may
reveal the defect and repair; it must not be exposed to the generation agent.

### `inputs/prompt.txt`

The exact prompt delivered to the agent after resolving its environment
variables. Agent-facing instructions remain in the selected prompt template.
For localized tasks this contains the sanitized production path or enclosing
symbol, but no private patch text, changed line numbers, or expected behavior.

### `image-build/runtime.json`

The exact locally built Docker image ID used by the run. Reevaluation requires
this image to remain available. Its source images are detailed in
`image-build/images.json`.

## `image-build/`

### Build contexts and inputs

`image-build/harnesses/` and `image-build/runtime/` contain copies of the
checked-in Dockerfiles, the harness package lock, and public Python helpers.
These directories are isolated build contexts containing only approved assets.
Host run data and credentials do not enter either context. The runtime recipe
copies the complete locked harness toolchain from its reusable image and extends
the prepared repository image.

`requested.json` records source/Node references, platform, all installed harness
pins, and the package-lock hash before any pull. `harnesses.inputs.json` and
`runtime.inputs.json` record non-secret arguments, platform, recipe name, and
SHA-256 hashes of all context files before their builds. Cache tags depend on
these inputs, including lockfile and helper contents.
### `image-build/images.json`

Configured references and resolved IDs or digests for the repository, Node,
shared harness-toolchain, and final runtime images. It also records the requested
harness pins, lockfile hash, and each installed CLI's observed `--version`
output. This record is updated as each image becomes available, so interrupted
builds can contain only the completed stages.

### `image-build/output.log`

Raw SDK JSON events from pulls and builds, including build failure evidence.
It may be empty when all images are cached.

## `generation/`

### `generation/session.log`

The readable agent transcript generated from `trace.jsonl`: prompt, agent
messages, exposed tool calls and results, errors, standard error, and the harness
result. This is the best file for reviewing what the agent did.

It cannot include hidden reasoning that the provider did not expose. Tool output
may already be truncated by the CLI. `oracle-bench report` can rebuild it without
a model call.

### `generation/trace.jsonl`

Raw newline-delimited events emitted by Codex, Claude Code, or OpenCode. Event shapes depend
on the pinned CLI version. This is the authoritative low-level transcript used to
extract completion, errors, usage, cost, and `session.log`.

### `generation/command.json`

The exact agent CLI argument vector, including model, isolation flags, provider
overrides, and the configured stopping limit. Credential values are absent.

### `generation/version.txt`

Output of the selected harness's `--version` command inside the container.

### `generation/final.txt`

The agent's final natural-language response. It may be empty when generation
fails or times out.

### `generation/result.json`

Normalized generation metadata.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `status` | `completed`, `failed`, or `timeout` |
| `exit_code` | Agent process exit code |
| `duration_seconds` | Agent process wall time |
| `timed_out` | Whether the harness timeout terminated it |
| `turn_completed`, `turn_failed` | Terminal event flags parsed from the trace |
| `errors` | Structured errors extracted from the trace |
| `unparsed_trace_lines` | Lines that were not valid JSON |
| `usage` | Provider/CLI token data, or null |
| `cost_usd` | CLI-reported cost for Claude, otherwise null |
| `model_usage` | Claude's optional per-model breakdown |

Provider usage structures are semi-structured and may change between CLI
versions.

### Agent logs

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `stderr.log` | Agent CLI standard error; often empty on success |
| `setup.log` | Generation-container creation, repository reset/rebuild, test visibility, and initial snapshot diagnostics |
| `launch.log` | Agent launch and setup diagnostics |
| `capture.log` | Final snapshot, workspace diff, and generated-file copy diagnostics |

Agent stdout goes to `trace.jsonl`, so `launch.log` is not the transcript. SDK
transfers and snapshot tools are normally silent. Streamed agent output is
redacted before host writes, including credentials split across output chunks.

### Workspace preparation inputs

`generation/workspace.json` (and the corresponding file in each evaluation directory)
records public workspace preparation inputs: repository path, generated directory,
test visibility, and test globs. It contains no private patches or credentials.

### `generation/baseline.txt`

The Git commit created immediately before generation. It includes the selected
existing-test visibility and empty generated-test directory and anchors the final
workspace diff.

### `generation/before.json` and `generation/after.json`

Complete filesystem metadata snapshots before and after generation. Every
repository-relative path maps to its entry kind, Unix mode, size, and SHA-256.
Their comparison determines allowed files and forbidden changes independently of
Git status. These can be large, but contain metadata rather than every file's
contents.

### `generation/workspace.diff`

The complete Git-oriented diff from `baseline.txt` through the final agent state,
including staged, unstaged, and untracked changes. Use it to inspect policy
violations and production edits.

## `submission/`

### `submission/files/`

The frozen submission. Each allowed new regular file is copied here while
preserving its repository-relative path. Evaluations copy these exact files into
fresh buggy and golden workspaces. The directory may be absent for an empty
submission.

### `submission/manifest.json`

The artifact inventory and compliance decision.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `files` | Allowed paths mapped to SHA-256 and Unix mode |
| `forbidden_changes` | Changed paths that violated capture policy |
| `compliant` | Whether `forbidden_changes` is empty |
| `empty` | Whether no allowed files were captured |
| `sha256` | Hash of the canonical `files` mapping |

Before evaluation, Oracle Bench verifies the manifest checksum, every captured
file's checksum, and that the bundle contains no unmanifested files. It rejects
silent modification of the frozen artifact.

## `ground-truth/`

`issue.md` contains the SWE-bench problem statement in readable form.
`fix.patch` is the exact golden patch applied to transform the buggy checkout.
Both are private evaluator evidence retained for human analysis; neither is
available inside the generation container.

## Evaluation directories

`evaluation/buggy/`, `evaluation/golden/`, `reference-check/buggy/`, and
`reference-check/golden/` use the same layout. The evaluation pair evaluates generated tests; the reference pair checks
the private developer regression before generation. Golden directories also have
`repair.patch`; reference directories have `reference.patch`.

### `tests.json`

Normalized pytest results.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `status` | Overall execution status |
| `exit_code` | pytest exit code |
| `collected` | Number of collected tests |
| `collection_errors` | Structured collection failures |
| `tests` | Pytest node IDs mapped to outcomes and phase records |

Each test records its normalized outcome and available setup, call, and teardown
phases, including phase outcome, duration, and failure details. Outcomes preserve
passes, failures, skips, expected failures, unexpected passes, and setup or
teardown errors.

Incomplete statuses include `no_tests`, `timeout`, `runner_error`, and
`infrastructure_error`, with an `error` explanation. A failing assertion is an
ordinary per-test failure and does not make the overall execution incomplete.

### Coverage files

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `coverage.json` | Stable normalized status, totals, percentage, and per-file data used by Oracle Bench |
| `coverage.raw.json` | Detailed unmodified JSON emitted by the configured coverage.py version |
| `.coverage` | Binary coverage.py data file, requiring a compatible coverage version to inspect |

When coverage is unavailable, `coverage.json` contains `status: unavailable` and
a reason. Coverage failure does not discard test results.

### Other execution files

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `imports.json` | Configured modules mapped to imported file paths, detecting accidental use of another installed copy |
| `runner.json` | Inputs to the in-container runner: workdir, output, targets, source roots, and imports |
| `command.json` | Concrete pytest command; distinct from the agent command |
| `execution.json` | Runner exit code, duration, and timeout flag |
| `output.log` | Workspace setup, patching, pytest, coverage, and Docker diagnostics |
| `repair.patch` | Exact golden source patch, only in golden executions |
| `reference.patch` | Private test patch, only in reference executions |

Start with `output.log` when `tests.json` reports a runner or infrastructure
failure.

## `reference-check/results.json`

The paired private-regression result. It has the same matrix shape as the paired
portion of `evaluation/results.json`. Generation begins only when
At least one `fail_on_buggy_pass_on_golden` matrix entry is required, verifying
the base commit, repair, private test, and environment before model spending.

## Reevaluation archives

Running:

```sh
uv run oracle-bench evaluate runs/<run-id>
```

moves the current contents of `evaluation/` into
`evaluation-history/<UTC timestamp>/`, verifies the frozen manifest, and evaluates it in
fresh containers. Generation evidence, provenance, runtime identity, and frozen
tests remain unchanged. Earlier reevaluations therefore remain available for
comparison.

Reevaluation marks an existing `judge/judgment.json` as `stale` because its saved
execution evidence has been replaced. Human judgments are marked stale for the
same reason. Each stale record retains the previous normalized judgment for audit.
Reevaluation never calls the judge model; invoke `oracle-bench judge` explicitly
to produce a new automated annotation.

`generation/session.log` is rendered from the original trace when generation
finishes. It is generation evidence rather than an evaluation result and is not archived.

## Empty, optional, and absent files

Several files are expected to be empty or absent in normal circumstances:

- `generation/launch.log`, `generation/capture.log`, and sometimes `generation/stderr.log` are
  empty when normally silent commands succeed;
- `image-build/output.log` may be minimal or absent when the runtime is cached;
- `generation/final.txt` may be empty after an agent failure;
- `submission/files/` may be absent for an empty submission;
- raw and binary coverage files may be absent when coverage fails;
- `evaluation/results.json` and `report.md` are absent if the pipeline stops before final
  evaluation.

Interpret absence together with `status.json`, the relevant `execution.json`, and
the closest stage log.

# Batch artifacts

`oracle-bench batch` writes a batch directory containing the original manifest,
the resolved and checksum-locked job list, batch status, `summary.json`, and
`report.md`. The summary preserves each job's state, run-directory link, paired
matrix counts, coverage, and generation measurements. When a run has judge
artifacts, its job record also contains the judge status, five rubric labels,
model provenance, token usage, duration, and cost. Runs without judge
configuration are recorded as `disabled`; configured runs without a result are
`missing`. Invalid, failed, timed-out, and stale judgments remain explicit and do
not make an otherwise completed evaluation resumable.

`summary.json` distinguishes three useful denominators:

- `attempted`: jobs that started;
- `completed_evaluations`: jobs whose buggy and golden executions both completed;
- `judge.valid_judgments`: jobs with a normalized `completed` judgment.

`matrix_detection_rate` is the fraction of completed evaluations with a compliant
fail-on-buggy/pass-on-golden result. `judge_confirmed_issue_reproduction_rate` is
the fraction of valid judgments labeled `confirmed_issue_reproduction`. These
metrics answer different questions and are reported separately.
`detection_rate_attempted` reports the same detections over every attempted job,
matching SWE-bench's resolved/submitted denominator.

The `judge` object contains status counts, per-facet label frequencies, and these
cross-tabs:

- matrix detection by final verdict;
- issue-target alignment by matrix detection;
- oracle alignment by the presence or absence of each matrix cell.

Generation and judge costs are totaled separately as `generation_cost_usd` and
`judge_cost_usd`, and `total_cost_usd` is their sum. Each is `null` when no
harness reported a cost. Per-job records use the same `generation_` prefix, so a
job's model spend is never confused with its judge's. The Markdown report
presents a compact per-run comparison and the facet frequency tables; the
complete cross-tabs remain in `summary.json`.

# Agreement artifacts

After blinded human ratings have been collected, run the offline agreement
analysis for a batch:

```sh
uv run oracle-bench agreement batches/<batch-id> --sample-per-stratum 8
```

The command writes `agreement/report.md`, `agreement/summary.json`, and
`agreement/calibration-sample.json` inside the batch directory. It never loads
credentials, starts containers, or calls a model.

Agreement is reported independently for all five rubric facets and separately
for human–human and human–LLM comparisons. Each result contains its observation
count, raw agreement, an observation-weighted mean of the per-rater-pair Cohen's
kappas, a pooled confusion matrix, and individual disagreements. Each rater pair
also retains its own expected agreement and Cohen's kappa. A pair enters these calculations
only when both ratings are valid and complete. Possible, available, and missing
pair counts are explicit, and every absent rater is retained as `status:
missing` in the per-run records. Kappa is `null` when no observations exist or
when expected agreement is one.

The report records every rubric, LLM prompt, human instruction, and workspace
specification hash together with the judge model identities. This makes results
from changed rating conditions visible instead of silently combining them.

The calibration sample lives only in `calibration-sample.json`; `summary.json`
carries the agreement figures and per-run ratings. The sample selects a
deterministic maximum per stratum for F→P, F→F, P→P, invalid, and LLM-judged
unrelated submissions, ordered by a hash of each run's instance ID and directory
name, so relocating a batch does not change the selection. A run may appear in
more than one stratum. The sample records whether every unique selected run has
at least two completed human ratings; agreement is not presented as calibrated
until that condition is met. Do not give the sample manifest or existing labels
to raters—the interactive workspace remains the blinded rating interface.
