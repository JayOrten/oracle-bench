# Judge workspace instructions

Use this guide alongside `rubric.md`. It explains the workspace and summarizes
execution evidence without assigning rubric labels.

## Reading order

1. Read `instance/issue.md`, `instance/fix.patch`, and
   `instance/reference-tests.patch` to establish the expected behavior.
2. Read the generated test files listed below in `buggy/`. The same generated
   files are present in `golden/`.
3. Use the paired-outcome table below to see what each generated test did on
   both repository versions.
4. Open the detailed JSON or raw logs when the summary is insufficient.

## Human judgment

Fill `output/judgment.json` using the labels in `rubric.md`, then save it. Use
JSON `null` for the branch that does not apply. The host validates and collects
the saved file; do not edit the read-only evidence.

## Workspace folders

- `instance/`: the private SWE-bench issue, golden repair, reference-test patch,
  and identifying metadata.
- `evidence/`: saved generation and test-execution evidence explained below.
- `buggy/`: the buggy repository checkout with the captured generated tests added.
- `golden/`: the repaired repository checkout with the exact same generated tests added.
- `output/`: the editable human judgment file.

## Evidence files

- `evidence/paired-results.json`: the normalized overall result. It pairs every
  generated test's buggy and golden outcomes and assigns matrix labels such as
  `fail_on_buggy_pass_on_golden`.
- `evidence/buggy-tests.json` and `evidence/golden-tests.json`: structured pytest
  results for each version, including collection status, individual tests,
  phases, and failures.
- `evidence/buggy-output.log` and `evidence/golden-output.log`: raw execution
  logs for tracebacks, collection errors, setup failures, and details omitted
  from the JSON summary.
- `evidence/workspace.diff`: every repository change made during generation.
  It is a compact view of test code added by the agent and any forbidden edits.
- `evidence/submission-manifest.json`: the exact captured test-file inventory,
  hashes, and whether generation changed files outside the allowed test directory.
- `instance/metadata.json`: the instance ID, repository revision, and official
  SWE-bench test IDs.

## Production files changed by the repair

${repair_files}

## Files changed by the reference-test patch

${reference_test_files}

## Generated submission files

${submission_files}

## SWE-bench reference test IDs

${reference_test_ids}

## Paired outcome totals

${matrix_totals}

F→P is the expected distinguishing direction. P→P did not distinguish the
revisions, F→F rejected both, and P→F preferred buggy behavior.

## Generated-test outcomes

| Generated test | Buggy | Golden | Paired outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
${outcome_rows}

Other or incomplete outcomes: **${other_outcomes_count}**.
